### User Story

**AS A ** a **user**
**I WANT ** clear definitions, context, scope and goals  
**SO THAT** I can work efficiently.

> NOTES: The **SO THAT** line contains the business value of the card, if you struggle to provide this detail, you may want to reconsider the value of this card.

>All contextual info should be in the card. Having info in slack, emails, etc... makes difficult to collaborate. Therefore, let's put all the relevant information with the story.

>If we are discussing the story / issue, the **outcome** should be added to the story, **NOT** in the comments.
